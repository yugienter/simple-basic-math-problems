},
{
  id: 2,
  added: "2019-11-24",
  author: "Jane",
  content: "By cereals..."
}
```

#### Build GET /notes/:id

```
{
  id: 2,
  added: "2019-11-24",
  author: "Jane",
  content: "By cereals..."
}
```

#### Build GET /notes?author=John

```
{

To only install resolved dependencies in `package-lock.json`:

```sh
npm ci
```

#### Run the application

```sh
npm start
```

You can also run `node .` to skip the build step.

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.

#### Rebuild the project

To incrementally build the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

To force a full build by cleaning up cached artifacts:

```sh
npm run rebuild
```

#### Fix code style and formatting issues

```sh
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix such issues:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

#### Other useful commands
